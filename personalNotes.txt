  -- About linking --
These are the steps to successfully link the node_modules...
Step 1, have a project that has the node modules installed. This can be done by
npm create vite@latest ProjectName --template react
cd ProjectName
npm install #install the node modules
npm run dev #runs the website in developer mode, not necessary but a test to make sure everyting ok
npm init # initiates the package.json file that is necessary for the link, don't worry to much about the questions it asks


Step 2, create a new project that will link to the old

npm create vite@latest NewProjectName --template react
cd NewProjectName

Step 3, finally link and install vite manually
npx link ProjectName/node_modules #npx link is a more robust version of npm link
npm install --save-dev vite
npm run dev #if this runs and the website looks good then its accomplished!
