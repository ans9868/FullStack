For 3.10/3.11 its needed to put the website publicly. To do so costs money for the most part so I will delay until I submit the homework. 
To submit...
Find a website hoster
upload 3.9 as it is 
make the start command to run the server as "npm run dev" 
...Done!...
I think for 3.9 its just the server or the frontend that has to be online, but if one is online both are online so two birds one stone
